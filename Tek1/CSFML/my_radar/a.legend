my_radar project involves creating a radar simulation program in C using CSFML.
this program simulates the movement of airplanes and their interactions with control towers on a radar screen.
airplanes are represented with their positions, velocities, and other flight parameters.
control towers have specific locations and influence the airplanes' status.

key features of the program:

the simulation includes:
    - planes with defined paths
    - velocities
    - statuses such (such as landed or exploded)

control towers in the simulation have:
    - a set radius and can detect planes
    - when a plane enters a tower's radius, it's considered safe
    - if planes collide outside the radius, they explode

interactions:
    - press 'L' to show/hide hitboxes
    - press 'S' to show/hide hitboxes

the simulation is visualized in a CSFML window, displaying planes, towers, and their interactions.

my_radar detects collisions between planes and changes their status to exploded if they collide outside the safety radius of towers
during the simulation, statistics like the number of planes that landed safely and those that exploded are displayed.
the program includes proper memory management to prevent leaks and handles errors effectively.
my version of my_radar has no memory leaks.

you can use the generator.py that you can find in the \tests folder to generates map for my_radar
    - try "python generator.py -h" for help
    - or you can use the given tests maps in the \tests folder

you can find my_radar usage by compiling the project with :
    - "make" or "make re"
    - then "./my_radar -h" for usage
